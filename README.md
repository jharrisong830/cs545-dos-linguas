npm install
```

To start the application, run the following:

The application can be viewed at http://localhost:5173. Explore the grammar and vocabulary lessons and each of their categories. Each lesson contains a knowledge check quiz at the end to help you practice the material. 

Once you've completed all of the lessons, you can try the "Conversations" quiz, which contains more complex questions that combine aspects of the previous lessons.
